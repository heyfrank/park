 It's All Over But the Crying 
 by The Ink Spots

It's all over, but the crying
And nobody's crying but me
Friends all over know I'm trying
To forget about how much I care for you

It's all over, but the dreaming
Poor little dreams that keep trying to come true
It's all over, but the crying
And I can't get over crying over you

It's all over, but the crying
And nobody's crying but me
Friends all over know I'm trying
To forget about how much I care for you

It's all over, but the dreaming
Poor little dreams that keep trying to come true
It's all over, but the crying
And I can't get over crying over you
